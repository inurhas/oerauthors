Beginning in preschool and kindergarten, students are taught to practice various societal roles. The French sociologist Ã‰mile Durkheim (1858-1917), who established the academic discipline of sociology, characterized schools as \"socialization agencies that teach children how to get along with others and prepare them for adult economic roles\" (Durkheim 1898).\n\nThe National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest) is committed to ending the bias and other flaws seen in standardized testing. Their mission is to ensure that students, teachers, and schools are evaluated fairly.
